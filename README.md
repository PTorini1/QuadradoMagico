# QuadradoMagico
An interesting challenge purposed in my System Development Course in SENAI.

I had to make a Magic Square which is a square composed by 9 numbers and the sum of lines, columns and diagonals of this square will always be the same like in the picture below.

So I developed a program that can always make a magic square.
